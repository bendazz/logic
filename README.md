# Interactive Discrete Mathematics - Predicate Logic

An interactive web application designed to help students learn the fundamentals of predicate logic in discrete mathematics.

## Features

### ðŸ“Š Truth Tables
- Complete truth tables for basic propositions (P, Q, Â¬P, Â¬Q)
- Comprehensive truth tables for logical operations:
  - Conjunction (âˆ§) - AND
  - Disjunction (âˆ¨) - OR
  - Exclusive OR (âŠ•) - XOR
  - Implication (â†’) 
  - Biconditional (â†”)

### ðŸ”§ Logical Operations
Interactive explanations and examples of:
- **Negation (Â¬)**: Flips the truth value
- **Conjunction (âˆ§)**: True only when both operands are true
- **Disjunction (âˆ¨)**: True when at least one operand is true
- **Exclusive OR (âŠ•)**: True when exactly one operand is true

### ðŸŽ® Interactive Truth Table Generator
- Build custom logical expressions
- Choose from propositions P, Q, R
- Select operations: AND, OR, XOR, IMPLIES
- Apply negation to either operand
- Generate truth tables dynamically
- Real-time expression display

### ðŸ§© Practice Problems
Three comprehensive practice problems with solutions:

1. **Basic Truth Table Completion**: Complete Â¬P âˆ¨ Q truth table
2. **Multiple Choice**: Understanding exclusive OR (XOR)
3. **Complex Expression Evaluation**: Step-by-step evaluation of (P âˆ§ Q) âˆ¨ (Â¬P âˆ§ R)

Each problem includes:
- Interactive answer inputs
- Immediate feedback
- Detailed solution explanations
- Visual indicators for correct/incorrect answers
